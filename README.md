### About me
Hey! Welcome to my github page! I'm Dotta, a software developer with some background in gamedev. 

Working with software is my dream job since I was 12 (I didn't know the name of it at the time, but I knew I wanted to make computer things).

### What I'm working on
Most of my free time is spent on my post-grad project so I my personal projects are on hold for now.

I enjoy working with CLI projects that make my life easier but I plan on working in some open source projects in the close future!

When I have some time and energy, I usually spend it learning Go or some other new tech that caught my attention somewhere on the internet.

### My hobbies
I enjoy gaming, music, gym and bouldering (kinda new to it, been falling a lot).

Those are the main things but I'm always trying something new!
